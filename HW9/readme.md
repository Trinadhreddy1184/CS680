# Composite Design Pattern Implementation

## Overview

In this Composite design pattern implementation, the `SmartDevice` class serves as the base class for both `Zone` and `Device` objects. The `Zone` class represents a room, which can contain zero or more smart devices, while the `Device` class represents a single smart device. The `SmartHomes` class manages the overall smart home system, which consists of one or more zones.

## Components

- `SmartDevice` (abstract): Base class for `Zone` and `Device`.
- `Zone`: Represents a room, which can contain zero or more smart devices.
- `Device`: Represents a single smart device.
- `SmartHomes`: Manages the overall smart home system, which consists of one or more zones.

## Test Fixture Initialization

The `ZoneFixtureInitializer` class is responsible for initializing zones and devices for testing.

## Unit Tests

The following unit tests should be implemented:

- `DeviceTest`: Tests the `Device` class.
- `SmartHomesTest`: Tests the `SmartHomes` class.
- `ZoneTest`: Tests the `Zone` class.
