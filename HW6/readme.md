# Composite Design Pattern Implementation

## Overview

In this Composite design pattern implementation, the `FSElement` class serves as the base class for both `Directory` and `File` objects. The `Directory` class represents a directory, while the `File` class represents a file. The `FileSystem` class manages the overall file system structure.

## Components

- `FSElement` (abstract): Base class for `Directory` and `File`.
- `Directory`: Represents a directory.
- `File`: Represents a file.
- `FileSystem`: Manages the file system structure.

## Test Fixture Initialization

The `TestFixtureInitializer` class is responsible for creating a file system structure for testing.

## Unit Tests

The following unit tests should be implemented:

- `DirectoryTest`: Tests the `Directory` class.
- `FileTest`: Tests the `File` class.
- `FileSystemTest`: Tests the `FileSystem` class.
