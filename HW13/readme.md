# Strategy Design Pattern Implementation for Comparators on Car using Lambda Expressions

## Overview

In this Strategy design pattern implementation, we have implemented different comparators for sorting `Car` objects based on various criteria such as mileage, price, year, etc. The comparators are implemented using lambda expressions for simplicity and conciseness.

## Components

- `Car`: Represents a car object.

## Unit Tests

The following unit tests should be implemented:

- `CarComparatorTest`: Tests the sorting functionality using different comparators implemented with lambda expressions.
- `CarTest`: Tests the `Car` class.
